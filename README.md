## Rust Bitcoin: A Rust Implementation of "Programming Bitcoin"

This project is a personal Rust implementation of the code from Jimmy Song's book "Programming Bitcoin," which was originally written in Python. The idea emerged during my participation in a series of meetups organized by [Rust en Espa√±ol](https://www.meetup.com/rust-argentina) focused on learning Rust while reimplementing the book chapter by chapter.

The chapters are:

- [x] [Chapter 01: Finite Fields](https://github.com/cypherchabon/programming-bitcoin-rs/tree/chapter_01_finite_fields)
- [x] [Chapter 02: Elliptic Curves](https://github.com/cypherchabon/programming-bitcoin-rs/tree/chapter_02_elliptic_curves)
- [x] [Chapter 03: Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://github.com/cypherchabon/programming-bitcoin-rs/tree/chapter_03_elliptic_curve_cryptography)
- [x] [Chapter 04: Serialization](https://github.com/cypherchabon/programming-bitcoin-rs/tree/chapter_04_serialization)
- [x] [Chapter 05: Transactions](https://github.com/cypherchabon/programming-bitcoin-rs/tree/chapter_05_transactions)
- [ ] Chapter 06: Script
- [ ] Chapter 07: Transaction Creation and Validation
- [ ] Chapter 08: Pay to Script Hash
- [ ] Chapter 09: Blocks
- [ ] Chapter 10: Networking
- [ ] Chapter 11: Simplified Payment Verification
- [ ] Chapter 12: Bloom Filters
